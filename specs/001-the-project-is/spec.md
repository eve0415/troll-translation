# Feature Specification: Apple Live Translation Meme Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-project-is`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The project is a web-based tool that enables anyone to generate parody images in the style of Apple's "Live Translation" feature demonstrations. Users will be presented with a simple page containing two input fields, one aligned to the left and the other to the right, where they can type any text they like. Once the text is entered, the system automatically renders a meme-style image that faithfully imitates the Apple-inspired layout: a centered silhouette resembling an AirPods-like shape in neutral gray tones, black text displayed neatly on the left side, and multicolored gradient text on the right side that transitions smoothly from purple to pink to red. The background remains plain white, the spacing is generous, and the typography is clean and modern to closely capture the visual impression of the original demonstration. The entire composition should look polished and consistent without requiring users to adjust fonts, spacing, or colors manually.

The motivation for building this tool comes from the popularity of this meme format in social networks and group chats. People currently recreate the look by manually editing images, which takes time and skill, but the appeal of the meme lies in its immediacy and recognizability. By automating the visual style and handling all the formatting details, this project lowers the barrier to participation, making it possible for anyone to produce an authentic-looking meme within seconds. The result is a ready-to-use image that can be copied and pasted anywhere, ensuring that users can focus entirely on the humor or commentary they want to convey rather than on design work.

To make sharing effortless, the tool should generate downloadable image outputs directly from the input text, and it should also support automatic Open Graph image generation through Cloudflare Workers, so that a link to the created meme will display the image correctly on any platform. In addition, a dedicated "share by tweet" button will allow users to post their creations directly on X without additional steps. These features reinforce the central purpose of the project: to provide a seamless, fast, and visually accurate way for people to join in the "Live Translation" meme format and spread their versions across different platforms with minimal friction. This is the output image I want '/workspaces/troll-translation/magical_experience_live_translation__gjk070yu926a_large_2x.jpg'."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to create a parody meme in the style of Apple's Live Translation feature. They visit the web tool, enter text in two input fields (left and right), and immediately get a polished image that mimics Apple's demonstration style. They can then download the image or share it directly on social media.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the meme generator page, **When** they enter "Hello" in the left field and "Bonjour" in the right field, **Then** a meme image is automatically generated showing black "Hello" text on the left, gradient "Bonjour" text on the right, with the Apple-style AirPods silhouette in the center
2. **Given** a generated meme image is displayed, **When** the user clicks the download button, **Then** the image file is saved to their device with a meaningful filename
3. **Given** a generated meme image is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Share on X", **Then** a pre-populated tweet window opens with the meme image attached
4. **Given** a user shares a link to their generated meme, **When** the link is posted on social media, **Then** the correct meme image appears as the preview thumbnail

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one or both input fields are empty?
- How does the system handle very long text that might overflow the image boundaries?
- What occurs if special characters or emojis are entered in the text fields?
- How does the system behave when the user rapidly changes input text?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide two text input fields positioned on left and right sides of the interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically generate a meme image when text is entered in either input field
- **FR-003**: System MUST render the left text in black color with clean, modern typography
- **FR-004**: System MUST render the right text with a gradient transitioning from purple to pink to red
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a centered AirPods-like silhouette in neutral gray tones
- **FR-006**: System MUST use a plain white background for all generated images
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain generous spacing and polished visual consistency matching Apple's demonstration style
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a download button that saves the generated image to the user's device
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a "Share on X" button that opens a pre-populated tweet with the image
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate Open Graph images for shared links to display correctly on social platforms
- **FR-011**: System MUST update the generated image in real-time as users type in the input fields
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle empty input fields gracefully without breaking the image generation
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure generated images are high quality and suitable for sharing across platforms

### Key Entities
- **Meme Image**: The generated visual output containing left text, right text, center silhouette, with Apple-style formatting and layout
- **Text Input**: User-provided content for left and right sides of the meme, supporting standard text characters
- **Shareable Link**: URL that generates Open Graph images for social media preview functionality
